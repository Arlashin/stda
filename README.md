# Software Tools for Data Analysis
This is the course I am teaching for students in MA in Applied Economics program at Woods College of Advancing Studies.
The course's two main goals are (a) provide students with an introduction to a set of software tools commonly used today for performing exploratory data analysis both in academic research and business applications and (b) serve as a support course for  other courses in MSAE program.
